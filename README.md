# Extended Vehicle Parameters
## World of Tanks (PC) Modification
## Latest Release
1.0.0 for World of Tanks v.11.0.0

## Description
This mod adds additional parameters to the vehicle statistics panel in the garage. Some of these parameters exist in the game but are hidden, others are useful vehicle characteristics I calculate myself. Unlike other existing mods/internet tools, this mod calculates actual parameters values based on crew training, skill levels, mounted equipment and other factors. It also supports the in-game comparison tool so you can compare hidden vehicle statistics between multiple vehicles or vehicle configurations.

## List of Added Parameters
### Overall
- Overall vehicle performance calculated by averaging the five vehicle categories (Firepower, Mobility, Survivability, Visibility, Camo)
 
### Firepower
- Moving dispersion penalty
- Hull traverse dispersion penalty
- Gun traverse dispersion penalty

Planned:
- Gun module damage

### Mobility
- Engine torque (ft lb)
- Max engine RPM
- Actual top speed (how fast the vehicle can actually go on flat ground)
- Terrain resistance (hard/medium/soft)
- Rolling friction (hard/medium/soft)

Planned:
- Actual traverse speed
- Gearbox ratios (affects acceleration aka IS-7 vs Obj 277)
- Gearbox top speed (top speed going downhill)
